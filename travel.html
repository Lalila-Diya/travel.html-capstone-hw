    <p>Switzerland is a landlocked country in Central Europe, bordered by Germany, France, Italy, Austria, and Liechtenstein,
    known for its stunning Alpine landscapes and high standard of living. It is a federal republic of 26 cantons, with four
    official languages—German, French, Italian, and Romansh. While Bern is the de facto capital, Zurich is the largest city,
    and the country is famous for its neutrality, although it has joined recent international sanctions.</p>
